            <p>Before you start this recipe, be sure to take a good look at your pantry. You’ll want to make sure you’ve
                got marshmallow bits for this recipe—not mini marshmallow. Mallow bits are just like those itty-bitty
                crunchy marshmallows you get in a packet of hot chocolate
                You can find small containers of Jet-Puffed Mallow Bits in your supermarket’s baking or hot beverage
                aisle—or you can always snag them online if you can’t track them down (I found that they sell out
                quickly close to the holidays).
                And if you’re at a total loss for finding these marshmallow tidbits, just be sure that the hot chocolate
                your choose has some included. Those will work just as well!</p>

                <h3>Stirring up the cookies</h3>

                    alt="HotChocolateCookies">
                <p>Making these hot chocolate cookies is a cinch. Just follow the standard cookie-making procedure (AKA
                    the creaming method). Cream together your softened butter, sugar and brown sugar. Then add in your
                    eggs and vanilla. Once those are incorporated, just add in the dry ingredients—save for the
                    marshmallow bits.</p>
                <p>Because these little marshmallows are a bit fragile, you’ll want to stir them in by hand or with the
                    lowest speed of your mixer. After all, these are the star of the show—you don’t want them broken
                    down into marshmallow powder.</p>

                            alt="HotChocolateCookies">
                        <p>These cookies are just as easy to bake up as any classic chocolate chipper. Using a
                            tablespoon or cookie scoop, portion out cookies onto a baking sheet and bake for 10-12
                            minutes at 375ºF. When they’re done, just set them on a rack to cool—though I thought they
                            tasted best a little warm!</p>

                            alt="HotChocolateCookies">
                        <p>This cookie is so simple to make and the results are absolutely mouthwatering. First off,
                            these cookies have that just-right slightly chewy texture to them which makes them great for
                            soft cookie fans like myself. Then you’ve got all those hot chocolate flavors courtesy of a
                            good
                            hot chocolate mix (these are our staff’s favorites), chocolate chips and those teeny tiny
                            marshmallows. Let’s be honest—those mini marshmallow bits are what truly take these cookies
                            over
                            the top. What’s a hot chocolate—or a hot chocolate cookie—without plenty of marshmallows</p>
                        <p>But do you want to know the secret for making this treat even better (yes, it is possible)?
                            Dunk your hot chocolate cookie right into your hot chocolate. It might seem like too much,
                            but gosh is it ever good!</p>
